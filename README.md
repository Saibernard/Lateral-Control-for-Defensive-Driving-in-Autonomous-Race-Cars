# autonomous-racing-lateral-control
Implemented Python and ROS2-based lateral controller for defensive racing in a F1 1/10 scale autonomous vehicle. Utilized vision for opponent detection, pure pursuit algorithms for path planning, and developed a custom planner using lidar and Intel Real Sense depth camera for safe, efficient race decisions.
